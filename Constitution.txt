Computer Science Club Constitution

Purpose: To promote computer skills and programming in a fun and enjoyable manner. Also, to help each other become better programmers, to learn stuff, and to gather a group of totally awesome people to (hopefully!) become friends!

Membership: The members may consist of any and all persons directly associated with the Franciscan University (i.e. Students and Faculty). To be a member, go to a club meeting, join the Discord chat (if you want, but you don't have to), and be awesome!

Meetings: The club shall meet on average once a week for an hour.  This time can be extended or shortened as needed.
Officers: The Officers shall consist of as follows:
	President — He or she has to be a current student of the Franciscan University. He shall be voted into office at the first meeting of any given school year. His term shall be for one year, after which he shall be deposed from office (forcibly if needed) and another election shall be held (at which the same person may be elected). He is in charge of maintaining the club and making sure that the club remains official. He shall be in charge of helping to arrange for speakers (although this is not soley his responsibility, and with his approval, others may help).
	Vice President — He or she shall be a current student of the Franciscan University. He shall be voted into office at the first meeting of any given school year. His term shall be the same as that of the president. His duties include (but are not limited to) assisting the President in all of his duties, especially if something happens to the President (eg. nuclear bomb, the plague, etc.).
	The faculty advisor may depose of any officer at any time for any reason.

Funding: As of right now, we don't think that we wil need funding. If we do, we'll decide what to do then. No member of the club should get paid for being a part of the club. If that's what you're looking for, you're in the wrong club.

Club Constitution Ratification: The Constitution shall be adopted by first being drafted by the current club President, reviewed and ammended as needed by the members of the club, then by approval of the faculty advisor.
